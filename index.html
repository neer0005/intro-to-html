        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/IMG_31872.jpg" alt="Image of self" width="500">
        <p> It's me, Avani! I am a first-year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I am obsessed with summertime and the sea 🌊.
            One of the reasons that I love summer is because it's beautiful for biking and swimming along the beach, which are two activities
        that I enjoy! I also get most of my artistic inspiration during summer and my colour choices express that.    </p>
        <p> I love to paint clouds and warm skies and to be outdoors as often as I can. I will admit that, though I try, I struggle to spend
            as much time outside during the winter. Another thing about me: I hate being cold and I am notoriously cold when no one else 
            is complaining. Either way, I try to keep my spirit warm.

        </p>
